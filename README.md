# Contiguous-and-Non-Contiguous-Memory-Management
 
 This project simulates contiguous memory allocation by utilizing algorithms such as next-fit, first-fit, and best-fit to place incoming processes into memory. Defragmentation may occur in these simulations. Additionally, it utilizes non-contiguous memory allocation as another management algorithm. These simulations use the first-fit approach and page tables to place memory chunks.
